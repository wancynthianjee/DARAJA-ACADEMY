        Daraja was started in 2009 by Jason and Jenny Doherty who were History teavhers from America.
        <br/>
        When Jason came to Africa and specifically Kenya for the fist  time he had a dream of opening <br/>
        a school that would help take girls that come from maginalized and humble communities to school that <br/>
        was to help the girls go to learn.

        His aim was to help those girls that wished to go to school to go so that they could learn and also 
        <br>
        also help those girls who would run away from home due to some of the challenges that they were facing from
        <br/>
        their communities such as forced marriages and circumcission.He also wanted to help those girls that were running
        <br/>
        away from home violence.The street girls who used to live on the streets and wanted to get the opportunity to 
        <br/>
        learn and get an education
